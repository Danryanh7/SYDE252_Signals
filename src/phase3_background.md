# Phase 3 Background
## Overview
One again, we're setting up a background.md file to report research briefs and facilitate knowledge transfer  
I'll update this file with cool stuff that I find and I recommend that you all do the same!

## Signal Exploration Tips
* Try playing each channel individually, taking note of which channels sound the best on which samples.  
For example, I found that the first channel is typically the best channel to sample from, that means that we 
should expand this channel out (weight it more heavily) when redistributing our filter.
* Try filters that have less group delay to reduce interference.  
* There is a decent amount of noise (as expected), what is causing this? Is this cumulative noise? Is this ringing caused by the  
filtering process? Might be worth investigating.
